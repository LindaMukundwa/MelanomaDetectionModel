# Melanoma AI Detection Tool

Tested and created a model based on a CNN and ABCD criteria to act as a medical tool for identifying signs of melanoma on skin, all within the AI4ALL's cutting-edge AI4ALL Ignite accelerator.

## Problem Statement

Our research question is **How well can a CNN model trained on ABCD visual criteria detect early signs of melanoma?** and one of our main reasons for embarking on this project was because melanoma is one of the deadliest forms of skin cancer, however when detected early, the 5-year survival rate for melanoma is **99%**.

In order to try and come up with a tool for this, we thought of using the ABCD markers to do these because they repressent 4 things to look out for that can detect signs of melanoma. These are:

**A** is for asymmetry where half of the spot is not symmetrical to the other
**B** is for border where thereâ€™s an irregular or undefined border on the spot
**C** is for color where there are varying colors present on the spot in different areas
**D** is for diameter where most melanomas are usually 6mm in diameter or smaller

This type of research and this type of work is very helpful because it can help to advance work in this area so that people can have access to resources like this and from all types of backgrounds and skin tones. Its impacts will show the importance of this kind of work and the need for responsible and impactful AI.


Key Results
(UPDATE IN README.md) Enumerate the main results of this project in a list and describe them.

EXAMPLE:

Recorded over 1,000 unique prompts and their responses generated by ChatGPT
Identified three biases in ChatGPT's responses
When prompted about this world event
When prompted about this field of science
When prompted about this political party
Methodologies
(UPDATE IN README.md)

EXAMPLE: To accomplish this, we utilized the OpenAI API to interact with ChatGPT, and we designed a custom Python script to generate diverse prompts and collect corresponding responses. The data was then processed and analyzed using pandas, enabling us to detect patterns and biases in the AI model's outputs. Engineered a Python script to generate over 1,000 prompts and elicit their responses from ChatGPT, utilizing pandas to collect the data. When prompted for solutions to this specific relevant crisis, nearly 80% of ChatGPT's responses promoted a certain worldview.
